Any author except for the creator __must__ write code in __non-master__ branch!  
Coding have two segments:  
- Engine core  
- Operation extensions  

Any code __must__ be documented. Just on top of `.h` files. If function has a lot of unique behaviors - document it right below function declaration.  
Any commit __must__ reveal reason why it was pulled (fixes, extentions, etc.).
